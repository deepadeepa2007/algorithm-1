## **Algorithm – Exam Explanation**

### **Definition of Algorithm**

An **algorithm** is a **finite set of well-defined step-by-step instructions** used to solve a specific problem or perform a computation.

---

### **Characteristics of an Algorithm**

An algorithm must have the following properties:

1. **Input** – It takes zero or more inputs.  
2. **Output** – It produces at least one output.  
3. **Definiteness** – Each step is clear and unambiguous.  
4. **Finiteness** – It must terminate after a finite number of steps.  
5. **Effectiveness** – Each step must be simple and executable.

### **General Format of an Algorithm (Exam Style)**

1. Start  
2. Step 1  
3. Step 2  
4. Step 3  
5. Stop

## **Example Algorithm (Very Important for Exams)**

### **Algorithm to Find the Sum of Two Numbers**

**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Read two numbers A and B  
**Step 3:** Calculate Sum \= A \+ B  
**Step 4:** Display Sum  
**Step 5:** Stop

---

### **Explanation of the Algorithm**

* The algorithm starts by taking two input values.  
* It performs addition on the inputs.  
* The result is stored in a variable called `Sum`.  
* Finally, the result is displayed and the algorithm stops.

## **Another Common Exam Example**

### **Algorithm for Selection Sort (Ascending Order)**

**Step 1:** Start  
**Step 2:** Read number of elements `n`  
**Step 3:** Read array elements  
**Step 4:** For `i = 0` to `n-2`  
    • Find the smallest element from `i` to `n-1`  
    • Swap it with element at position `i`  
**Step 5:** Repeat until array is sorted  
**Step 6:** Display sorted array  
**Step 7:** Stop

### **Advantages of Algorithm**

* Easy to understand and write  
* Language independent  
* Helps in program development  
* Improves problem-solving skills

---

### **Disadvantages of Algorithm**

* Time-consuming for complex problems  
* Difficult to show loops and conditions in long algorithms

---

### **Conclusion (For 10 Marks Answer)**

An algorithm provides a **clear and systematic method** to solve a problem. It is the **first step in program development** and helps programmers write correct and efficient programs.
